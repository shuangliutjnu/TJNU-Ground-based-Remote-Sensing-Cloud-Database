# TJNU-Ground-based-Remote-Sensing-Cloud-Database
An open source provided for ground-cloud related researchers to promote research

The TJNU ground-based remote sensing cloud database (TJNU-GRSCD) is collected in Tianjin, China from 2017 to 2018. It contains 8000 ground-based samples. According to the International cloud classification system criteria published in the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as well as the visual similarity of cloud in practice, the sky conditions are divided into seven sky types: 1) cumulus, 2) altocumulus and cirrocumulus, 3) cirrus and cirrostratus, 4) clear sky, 5) stratocumulus, stratus and altostratus, 6) cumulonimbus and nimbostratus, 7) mixed cloudness. Besides, cloud images with cloudiness no more than 10% are categorized into the clear sky. The TJNU-GRSCD is composed of 4,000 training samples and 4,000 test samples from seven classes, and each sample comprises one ground-based cloud image. The cloud images are captured by a camera and stored in JPEG format with the pixel resolution of 1024Ã—1024. All the samples are cooperatively annotated by the meteorologists and the ground-based cloud researchers. The TJNU-GRSCD will be provided free of charge to cloud-related researchers in order to promote research. Hereunder, some ground-based cloud images from each class are presented.
